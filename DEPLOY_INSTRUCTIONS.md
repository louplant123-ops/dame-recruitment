# ðŸš€ URGENT: Deploy Instructions to Fix Part 2 Registration

## The Problem
Your live website at https://damerecruitment.co.uk is still using the old ngrok URL that's no longer working.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\louis\OneDrive\Dame\dame-recruitment-fresh"
npm run build
# Then drag the 'out' folder to Netlify deploy page
```

### 2. Alternative: Use Git Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Part 2 registration endpoints"
git push origin main
```

## What's Fixed
- âœ… Part 2 form now tries multiple server endpoints
- âœ… Netlify function has fallback logic
- âœ… Better error handling and logging
- âœ… CORS headers properly set

## Test After Deploy
1. Go to your Part 2 registration form
2. Fill it out and submit
3. Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs
4. Should see "âœ… Success" message

## If Still Not Working
The form will now try these endpoints in order:
1. Railway server (if deployed)
2. Netlify function (as fallback)
3. Shows detailed error messages

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the Railway server with the updated code
2. Set environment variables in Netlify if needed
