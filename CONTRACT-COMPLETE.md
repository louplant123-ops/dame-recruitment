# ✅ CONTRACT SYSTEM COMPLETE

## What's Been Updated

### 1. **Netlify Functions** ✅
- `netlify/functions/get-contract.js` - Now fetches from DameDesk contacts table
- `netlify/functions/sign-contract.js` - Updates contacts table with signature

### 2. **Contract Signing Page** ✅
- Already exists at `/contract-signing`
- Shows contract summary with rates
- Captures digital signature
- Updates database when signed

### 3. **What Works Now**

**From DameDesk:**
1. Generate contract with rates/terms
2. Email sent with full contract T&Cs
3. Link: `https://damerecruitment.co.uk/contract-signing?id=CONTRACT_123`

**On Website:**
1. Client clicks link
2. Page loads contract from database
3. Shows rates and terms
4. Client signs
5. Database updates to "signed"
6. DameDesk shows signed status

## To Deploy

Your website is already on Netlify. Just push these changes:

```bash
cd dame-recruitment-fresh
git add netlify/functions/get-contract.js
git add netlify/functions/sign-contract.js
git commit -m "Update contract functions to use DameDesk database"
git push
```

Netlify will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes.

## Test It

1. **Generate contract** in DameDesk
2. **Click link** in email
3. **Should show:**
   - Company name
   - Contact name
   - Rates/terms
   - Signature form
4. **Sign it**
5. **Check DameDesk** - status = "signed"

## What's Missing (Optional Enhancement)

The contract signing page shows a summary but not the FULL T&Cs (8 sections for temp, 9 for perm).

If you want to add those, I can update the `page.tsx` to include all the legal terms before the signature section.

**Do you want me to add the full T&Cs to the signing page?**

Otherwise, the system is complete and ready to use!
