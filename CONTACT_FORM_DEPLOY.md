# 🚀 CONTACT FORM FIX - DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ BEFORE (Broken):
- Contact form used dead ngrok URL: `https://a78b850bd7bd.ngrok-free.app/api/contact`
- Bridge server called non-existent `processContactSubmission()` method
- All contact submissions were failing silently
- No proper routing for different contact types

### ✅ AFTER (Fixed):
- Contact form now uses Netlify function: `/.netlify/functions/contact-form`
- Smart routing based on inquiry type:
  - **Job Seekers** → Saved as `candidates` (type: 'candidate', temp: 'warm')
  - **Employers** → Saved as `prospects` (type: 'prospect', temp: 'hot') 
  - **General** → Saved as `contacts` (type: 'contact', temp: 'warm')
- Direct database integration (no bridge server needed)
- Proper error handling and logging

## Smart Routing Logic

### 📋 Form Field: `inquiryType`
- `job_seeker` → "I'm looking for work opportunities" → **Candidates page**
- `employer` → "I'm looking to hire talent" → **Prospects page** 
- `general` → "General inquiry/Other" → **General contacts**

### 🎯 Where You'll Find Contacts in DameDesk:
- **Job seekers** → **Candidates page** (filtered by source: 'website_contact_form')
- **Employers/Rate inquiries** → **Prospects page** (marked as 'hot' leads)
- **General inquiries** → **Contacts** (or create separate view)

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Build and Deploy
```bash
cd "C:\Users\louis\OneDrive\Dame\dame-recruitment-fresh"
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy Options

#### Option A: Netlify Drag & Drop
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag the `out` folder to deploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete

#### Option B: Git Deploy (if connected)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix contact form with smart routing"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test After Deploy
1. Go to your contact form: `https://damerecruitment.co.uk/contact`
2. Fill out form with different inquiry types
3. Check browser console (F12) for logs
4. Verify contacts appear in correct DameDesk sections

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in Netlify:
- `DB_HOST` - DigitalOcean database host
- `DB_PORT` - Database port (25060)
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (defaultdb)
- `DB_USER` - Database user (doadmin)
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Contact form submits without errors
- Success message shows with contact ID
- Contacts appear in correct DameDesk sections
- Console shows routing messages like:
  - "👤 Routing job seeker to candidates table"
  - "🏢 Routing employer to prospects table"
  - "📞 Routing general inquiry to contacts"

### 🔍 Debugging:
- Check Netlify function logs for detailed processing info
- Verify database connection in function logs
- Confirm contact appears in DameDesk with correct type and source

## Next Steps After Deploy

1. **Test all inquiry types** to ensure proper routing
2. **Check DameDesk** for new contacts in correct sections
3. **Set up filtering** in DameDesk by source: 'website_contact_form'
4. **Monitor function logs** for any errors

Your contact form now works like your registration forms - reliable, deployed to DigitalOcean, with smart routing! 🎉
